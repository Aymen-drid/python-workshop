# What is a Program?

A **program** is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task. It is written in a programming language and tells the computer how to perform a task step by step. Programs can range from simple tasks, like adding two numbers, to complex operations like running a website or operating system.

A program can:
- Take input from the user or other sources.
- Process that input to perform tasks or calculations.
- Output the result to the user or another system.

## Steps to Build a Program

Building a program typically involves these basic steps:

### 1. **Write the Code**
Writing the code means writing the instructions in a programming language. This step involves:
- **Choosing a programming language**: You pick the language you're most comfortable with or best suited for your task (e.g., Python, Java, C).
- **Creating a program file**: The code is written in a text editor (or an IDE) and saved with an appropriate file extension (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.java` for Java).
- **Writing the logic**: You structure the program using variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and other programming constructs.

Example in Python:
```python
# This program adds two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 7
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum)
