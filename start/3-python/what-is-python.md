## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python allows developers to write code that is clear and concise, which makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

Python is versatile and can be used for various applications, including:
- **Web development** (using frameworks like Django and Flask)
- **Data analysis** (with libraries like Pandas and NumPy)
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** (using TensorFlow, Keras, etc.)
- **Automation** (writing scripts for system administration tasks)
- **Scientific computing** (through libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib)
  
Its clean syntax and powerful libraries make it a popular choice for many industries and projects.


## What Do You Mean by High-Level Language?

A **high-level language** is a programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read, write, and understand. High-level languages are closer to human languages (such as English) than machine code, which is what a computer actually understands. They provide a level of abstraction from the computer's hardware, allowing developers to write programs without needing to manage the low-level details of memory or hardware.

### Key Characteristics of High-Level Languages:
- **Abstraction**: High-level languages abstract away the details of hardware and memory management, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about how the program interacts with the machine.
- **Readability**: The syntax of high-level languages is designed to be more readable and understandable to humans.
- **Portability**: Programs written in high-level languages can be run on different hardware platforms with little or no modification, as they don't rely on machine-specific details.
- **Ease of Use**: High-level languages usually come with built-in libraries and frameworks that simplify complex tasks, like file handling, networking, and database access.

Python is considered a high-level language because it is designed to be readable and easy to write, and it handles memory management automatically.
